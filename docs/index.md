## Hello from the Developer!

My name is Grant Staten, in Karen I am known as ကဆီထူ (kchawhtoo). I am currently a college student studying Electrical Engineering. I learned Karen by serving a 2 year mission for my church where I was assigned to serve in a Karen congregation in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Following my mission I began helping Kchawtee with Karenglish starting with this website, and plan to continue maintaining the site and helping with some Karenglish videos in the future. The website is currently thrown together with mkdocs and some simple html, js, and css, many future improvements will be made. Feel free to email me at [karenglish_dev@gwstaten.xyz](mailto:karenglish_dev@gwstaten.xyz) for any questions about this website or Karen in general.
